## D-0001 — Initial approved trading strategy

- **Date:** 2026-09-13
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Approved by:** Controller (project owner)
- **Context:** First codification of the trading policy from the project
  specification.
- **Decision:** Adopt the laddered entry with fixed Floor as documented in
  `strategy.md` (Buy 10 @ 0%, Ladder 1 +10 @ −5%, Ladder 2 +20 @ −8%,
  Floor SELL ALL @ −10%, all relative to the ORIGINAL INITIAL ENTRY FILL
  PRICE). Trailing Floor as documented in `strategy.md` §5.
- **Rationale:** Baseline policy for the paper-trading system. All future
  variations start as experiments and require a new APPROVED decision to
  become policy.
- **Supersedes:** none.

## D-0002 — Paper trading only

- **Date:** 2026-09-13
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Approved by:** Controller
- **Decision:** The system is paper trading only. Live trading is not
  enabled and requires explicit Controller change to this decision.
- **Rationale:** Safety while the system is being built and evaluated.

## D-0003 — Controller approval required for entries and ladders

- **Date:** 2026-09-13
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Approved by:** Controller
- **Decision:** The system may automatically monitor, compute, detect
  triggers, prepare orders, and notify. It must not submit initial
  entries, Ladder 1, Ladder 2, or discretionary entries without
  Controller approval. Approved protective exits (original Floor,
  activated Trailing Floor) may execute automatically at their approved
  triggers. See `execution.md`.
- **Rationale:** Human-in-the-loop for offensive orders; deterministic
  automation for defensive exits.

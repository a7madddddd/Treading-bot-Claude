## D-0001 — Initial approved trading strategy

- **Date:** 2026-09-13
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Approved by:** Controller (project owner)
- **Context:** First codification of the trading policy from the project
  specification.
- **Decision:** Adopt the laddered entry with fixed Floor as documented in
  `strategy.md` (Buy 10 @ 0%, Ladder 1 +10 @ −5%, Ladder 2 +20 @ −8%,
  Floor SELL ALL @ −10%, all relative to the ORIGINAL INITIAL ENTRY FILL
  PRICE). Trailing Floor as documented in `strategy.md` §5.
- **Rationale:** Baseline policy for the paper-trading system. All future
  variations start as experiments and require a new APPROVED decision to
  become policy.
- **Supersedes:** none.

## D-0002 — Paper trading only

- **Date:** 2026-09-13
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Approved by:** Controller
- **Decision:** The system is paper trading only. Live trading is not
  enabled and requires explicit Controller change to this decision.
- **Rationale:** Safety while the system is being built and evaluated.

## D-0005 — Timezone: routines run on US Central Time

- **Date:** 2026-09-14
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Approved by:** Controller
- **Decision:** All trading routines are scheduled in **US Central Time
  (America/Chicago)**. Controller's local timezone (UTC+3) is NOT used
  for routine scheduling. The scheduler must be **timezone-aware** so
  DST transitions (CST ↔ CDT) are handled automatically.
- **Rationale:** The strategy targets the US equity session; aligning
  routines to CT keeps pre-market / open / midday / EOD anchored to the
  market clock regardless of the Controller's local time.
- **Note:** A Middle-East workweek layer may be added later as a
  separate scheduling consideration; not now.

## D-0006 — Calendar: US market workdays only

- **Date:** 2026-09-14
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Approved by:** Controller
- **Decision:** Routines run on the **US market trading calendar** —
  weekdays only, with US market holidays and early-close days
  respected. Weekends are skipped.
- **Rationale:** No point running strategy routines when the US market
  is closed.

## D-0007 — Ladder-approval expiration remains TBD

- **Date:** 2026-09-14
- **Status:** DEFERRED (explicit TBD)
- **Approved by:** Controller (as a deferral)
- **Decision:** Do NOT invent a price band or a time window for
  ladder-approval expiration. The architecture may support expiration
  later, but the actual policy values remain TBD until the Controller
  sets them.
- **Rationale:** Safety — no invented risk-adjacent numbers.

## D-0008 — Trailing-floor calculation is threshold-based

- **Date:** 2026-09-14
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Approved by:** Controller
- **Decision:** When a trailing threshold is crossed, the new trailing
  floor is computed as **threshold_price × 0.95**, NOT as
  actual_tick × 0.95. This makes the ratchet deterministic and
  reproducible regardless of tick stream jitter or gaps.
- **Rationale:** Determinism during MVP; safer under gap-up conditions
  than tick-based (never claims a locked-in higher stop than the
  threshold rule guarantees).
- **Supersedes:** clarifies D-0001 and D-0004 for the "current market
  price" wording.

## D-0009 — Partial fills: reference-price basis

- **Date:** 2026-09-14
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Approved by:** Controller
- **Decision:**
  - The **original** Ladder / Floor reference (frozen initial entry
    fill price) is frozen **only after the initial entry order is fully
    filled or fully reconciled** (all of: filled, cancelled, or
    expired).
  - The **trailing-floor basis** (weighted-average filled entry price)
    updates continuously as fills reconcile.
- **Rationale:** Matches the source spec's "frozen after initial entry
  is fully reconciled" and preserves a live risk view for the trailing
  layer.

## D-0010 — Partial fill + cancel/expire of the initial entry

- **Date:** 2026-09-14
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Approved by:** Controller
- **Decision:** If the initial entry order is partially filled and then
  cancelled or expired, treat the **actual filled quantity** as the
  initial position and use the **weighted-average filled price** as the
  original reference. Unfilled shares are NOT part of the position and
  are NOT retried.
- **Rationale:** Keeps behavior explicit and safe; no invention of
  additional retry/roll policy.

## D-0011 — Ladder trigger source and debounce remain TBD

- **Date:** 2026-09-14
- **Status:** DEFERRED (explicit TBD)
- **Approved by:** Controller (as a deferral)
- **Decision:** Trigger source (trade prints vs bars vs quote midpoint)
  and any debounce policy (e.g. "two consecutive prints below trigger")
  remain TBD. Do NOT implement a debounce yet.
- **Rationale:** Trigger definition materially affects both signal
  frequency and safety; must be explicitly defined before code lands.

## D-0012 — Market data provider remains TBD

- **Date:** 2026-09-14
- **Status:** DEFERRED (explicit TBD)
- **Approved by:** Controller (as a deferral)
- **Decision:** Do NOT assume Alpaca IEX free tier, Alpaca SIP paid
  tier, or any external provider. Decision awaits further
  repository/integration inspection and Controller choice.

## D-0013 — Trading universe remains TBD

- **Date:** 2026-09-14
- **Status:** DEFERRED (explicit TBD)
- **Approved by:** Controller (as a deferral)
- **Decision:** The trading universe (single symbol / fixed list /
  dynamic watchlist) remains TBD until the architecture inspection is
  complete and the Controller decides.

## D-0004 — Trailing-floor thresholds are compounded 5% steps

- **Date:** 2026-09-13
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Approved by:** Controller
- **Context:** The source spec showed two arithmetic patterns for the
  trailing thresholds after activation. The example numbers ($115.50,
  $121.28, ~$115.22) match a compounded 5% ratchet, not a linear
  +5% step off the weighted-average entry.
- **Decision:** Trailing thresholds compound from the previous threshold:
  activation = avg_entry × 1.10; next = previous × 1.05. The trailing
  floor at each threshold is 5% below the market price used at that
  threshold (i.e. threshold × 0.95 when the threshold is exactly reached).
- **Rationale:** Matches the numerical examples in the source spec.
- **Supersedes:** none. Clarifies D-0001.

## D-0003 — Controller approval required for entries and ladders

- **Date:** 2026-09-13
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Approved by:** Controller
- **Decision:** The system may automatically monitor, compute, detect
  triggers, prepare orders, and notify. It must not submit initial
  entries, Ladder 1, Ladder 2, or discretionary entries without
  Controller approval. Approved protective exits (original Floor,
  activated Trailing Floor) may execute automatically at their approved
  triggers. See `execution.md`.
- **Rationale:** Human-in-the-loop for offensive orders; deterministic
  automation for defensive exits.
